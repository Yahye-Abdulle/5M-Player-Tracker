# 5M-Player-Tracker
Keep track on who's in a server through Discord.

## SETUP
---
Files that need set up:
- config.json
- database/database.db

Both files are straight-forward to fill

config.json requires information for the discord bot
database.db requires information to connect to db

db is not necessary as information can be stored under serverSettings where each data is stored as JSON
